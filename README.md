# Example Code for numerical implementation of our interpenetrating-network theory of cytoplasm

This repository contains example code and mesh files for the finite element implementation of the finite-deformation continuum-mechanical theory with a multi-branch visco-hyperelastic constitutive relation coupled with phase-field damage and healing which we developed for modeling the mechanical behavior of eukaryotic cytoplasm in our paper,
