# Example Code for numerical implementation of our interpenetrating-network theory of cytoplasm

This repository contains example code and mesh files for the finite element implementation of the finite-deformation continuum-mechanical theory with a multi-branch visco-hyperelastic constitutive relation coupled with phase-field damage and healing which we developed for modeling the mechanical behavior of eukaryotic cytoplasm in our paper,

 - "An interpenetrating-network theory of cytoplasm," Yang, Henzel, Stewart, et al. (2023) ([arXiv link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07256)).

Specifically, this code generates the curves of Figure 3(d) in the paper. 

You can also run the example code on Google Colab with the following link:
